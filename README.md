This repository contains a Docker file to build a Docker image with Apache Spark. This Docker image depends on our previous [Hadoop Docker](https://github.com/sequenceiq/hadoop-docker) image, available at the SequenceIQ [GitHub](https://github.com/sequenceiq) page.
The base Hadoop Docker image is also available as an official [Docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sequenceiq/hadoop-docker/).
